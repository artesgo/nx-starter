<h1 class="text-2xl md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">How to use this app</h1>

<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  This is an app that projects your budget into the future. There's some fiddling involved, but at least the recurring
  expense and incomes are mostly handled for you.
</div>

<h2 class="text-xl mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">Calendar</h2>
<bgt-flex-pair>
  <daisy-calendar></daisy-calendar>
  <div>
    Use the calendar to select dates, I think.. I don't remember.. try not to pick dates in the past, this app is more
    for future planning. Past dated items will be consolidated. (They are removed and grouped into the Todays balance
    item)

<h2 class="text-xl mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">The Table</h2>
<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  The table is a list of all of your budget items. You can edit the amount, manually recurr or delete the item.
</div>

<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  The app will automatically consolidate budget items that occur in the past into the current day. This of course can
  get out of date over time, but it's a simple update to Todays Balance (usually the first item) in the table.
</div>

<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  You will also have recurring expenses that you don't know the final total. Credit card debt is one of those things.
  Just add a recurring estimate and you can come back and update in the table as you go.
</div>

<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  There's also a search that will filter the table by description so you can edit a specific category quickly.
</div>

<h2 class="text-xl mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">The Cityscape</h2>
<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  This is a quick overview of your next 6 months. You can hover over the bars to see the estimated balance based on the
  budget items you've entered.
