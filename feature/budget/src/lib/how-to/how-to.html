<h2 class="text-xl mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">The Clicky Parts</h2>
<div class="flex flex-row gap-6 justify-between items-center md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto mb-8">
  <button [atgButton]="'primary'">Budget</button>
  <div>Budget creates the item based on all of the previous fields</div>
</div>

<div class="flex flex-row gap-6 justify-between items-center md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto mb-8">

  <div>
    <div>Recur to 6 months will look for recurring items in your budget and project them out 6 months</div>
    <div>You have to click the recur button every once in a while to update your data</div>
    <div>It uses the last occurrence of a recurring item to calculate the next one</div>
    <div>
      If you get done paying the government CPP taxes, you can add another Salary item with the updated amount instead
      of using Recur
    </div>
    <div>You may also have to delete some of the recurring items that aren't accurate and then run Recur again</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="flex flex-row gap-6 justify-between items-center md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto mb-8">
  <button [atgButton]="'secondary'">Buy me a Ko-fi</button>
  <div>
    Buy me a Ko-fi will take you to my Ko-fi page, if you want... it's not like I want you to buy me a coffee or
    anything.
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="text-xl mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">Why...</h2>
<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  I wanted an app that can somewhat keep track of my finances without too much fiddling. There's still some fiddling,
  but at least the recurring expense and incomes are handled for you.
</div>

<div class="mb-2 md:w-5/6 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  The app will automatically consolidate budget items that occur in the past into the current day. This of course can
  get out of date over time, so just delete it and re-enter the value with today's date as a non-recurring item. This is
  done to keep the number of bars in the barchart consistent and your data from bloating the browser storage.
